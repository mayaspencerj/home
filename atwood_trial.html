                <h1>Margaret Atwood <small>(Canada, 1939)</small></h1>
                <p class="lead">Margaret Atwood is an award-winning Canadian poet, novelist, literary critic, essayist, inventor, and environmental activist. Atwood was born in Ottawa to a nutritionist mother and entomologist father who fostered a love of nature. She grew up in Quebec and completed her studies at Victoria College at the University of Toronto, graduating in 1961. Over the course of her career, Atwood went on to teach at a variety of colleges and universities in both Canada and the United States.</p>
                <p class="lead">Atwood’s novels describe strong female characters and her work has been frequently qualified as feminist. A recurrent theme in Atwood’s work is dystopias and speculative fiction, what she defines as what “could really happen”, contractility to science function which “has monsters and spaceships”. Some of Atwood’s novels have been adapted for television, including <i>The Handmaid’s Tale</i> and <i>Alias Grace</i>.</p>

                    <p>“We were the people who were not in the papers. We lived in the blank white spaces at the edges of print. It gave us more freedom.
        We lived in the gaps between the stories.”</p>
