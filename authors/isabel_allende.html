                <h1>Isabel Allende <small>(Chile, 1942)</small></h1>
                <p class="lead">Isabel Allende is a Chilean writer and journalist. Allende was born in Lima (Peru), goddaughter of Salvador Allende, the first socialist president of Chile. She spent her childhood living in Chile with her grandfather, and then she lived in several different countries after her mother remarried to a diplomat. Allende's life drastically changed after the military coup in 1973 by Pinochet; she and her family were at risk and fled the country. Allende lived in exile in Venezuela for 13 years and then she moved to California, where she has lived since 1987.</p>
                <p class="lead">Her first bestseller, <i>The house of Spirits</i> (1982), started as a long letter to her dying grandfather. Allende's books are known for their vivid storytelling and she is one of the most well-known practitioners of magical realism. Her novels are often based upon her personal experience and historical events, and pay homage to the lives of women.</p>
