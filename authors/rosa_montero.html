                <h1>Rosa Montero <small>(Spain, 1951)</small></h1>
                <p class="lead">Rosa Montero is a Spanish journalist and contemporary fiction author. Montero was born in Madrid in 1951. Daughter of a bullfighter and a housewife, Montero suffered from tuberculosis as a child, what forced her to remain at home between the ages of five and nine; she began reading and writing extensively during that period.</p>
                <p class="lead">In 1976, Montero graduated from Madrid's School of Philosophy and Arts and she began working as a journalist at <i>El País</i>, a national newspaper, where she has been working for the last four decades. Years later she published her first novel <i>Crónica del Desamor</i> (<i>Chronicle of Enmity</i>), in 1979. Montero is a very influential Spanish author and has won numerous awards as a novelist and as a journalist. Many of her books remain to be translated into English.</p>

                    <p>“This book is about life… passionate and joyful, sentimental and quizzing”. After the death of her husband, Rosa Montero wrote this book, a personal memoir but also a tribute to the collective memory of the last decades in Spain. With an intimate narrative, the book talks about men and women, sex and death, the redeeming power of literature and the wisdom behind the simple pleasures of life. Presented with photos...</p>

                    <p>In 2010, Lucía Ramos, a one-time film director, is dying of cancer. She keeps two diaries, one chronicling the last months of her life, the other Easter Week 1980, when her first and only film opened. In that crucial week of her life, she was abandoned by one of her two lovers and, deciding to give up her difficult, independent lifestyle, moved in with the other. The tone in both diaries is disappointingly similar; melancholy, reflective...</p>
