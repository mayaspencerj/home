                <h1>Siri Hustvedt <small>(United States, 1955)</small></h1>
                <p class="lead">Siri Hustvedt is an American novelist and essayist, born in Minnesota in 1955 to a Norwegian mother and an American father. As a child, Hustvedt spent some time living in Bergen (Norway) and Reykjavik (Iceland): it was then when she decided she wanted to become a writer.</p>
                <p class="lead">Hustvedt graduated with a History BA from St. Olaf College and she moved to New York in 1978 to complete her PhD. There she met the novelist Paul Auster, to whom she married years later. Hustvedt's works repeatedly pose questions about the nature of identity, selfhood and perception, and in many of her books she presents the readers with traces of her own biography. Besides her fiction books, Hustvedt has published several essays on visual art, and she also writes on diverse interdisciplinary subjects that investigate the intersections among philosophy, psychoanalysis, and neuroscience.</p>
