                <h1>Alison Bechdel <small>(US, 1960)</small></h1>
                <p class="lead">Alison Bechdel is an American cartoonist. She is best known for the long-running comic strip <i>Dykes To Watch Out For</i>, which ran from 1983 to 2008 and was one of the earliest ongoing representations of lesbians in popular culture. Bechdel moved to Manhattan during the summer of 1981 and applied to many art schools but was rejected and worked in a number of office jobs in the publishing industry, during which she started drawing one panel comics that would eventually evolve into <i>Dykes To Watch Out For</i>In 2006, she became a best-selling and critically acclaimed author with her graphic memoir Fun Home.</p>
                <p class="lead">Bechdel is also known for the "Bechdel test", which asks whether a work of fiction features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. The test is used as an indicator for the active presence of women in films and other fiction, and to call attention to gender inequality in fiction.</p>
